This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API with custom functionalities. The camera preview might freeze or fail to render properly after certain actions, such as switching between camera types (front/rear) or toggling flash modes multiple times in quick succession.  This is intermittent and not easily reproducible with simple camera usage.  The error messages are usually vague and might not point directly to the `Camera` component itself.
