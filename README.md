# Expo Camera Preview Freeze

This repository demonstrates an intermittent bug related to the Expo `Camera` API. The camera preview may freeze or fail to render correctly after rapidly switching camera types or toggling flash modes.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `expo start`.
4. Rapidly switch between the front and rear cameras several times.
5. Rapidly toggle the flash mode on and off several times.

The preview may freeze at any point during these actions. The exact sequence that triggers the freeze is inconsistent.

## Bug and Solution

The `bug.js` file shows the implementation with the problematic behavior.  The `bugSolution.js` file presents a possible solution. This solution involves adding a small delay using `setTimeout`  before performing camera actions to help mitigate the issue by reducing the load on the camera component. The effectiveness may vary depending on the device and Expo version.

## Potential Solutions

* **Adding Delays:** Introduce short delays between camera operations. This appears to help but is not always effective. 
* **Asynchronous Operations:** Investigate if the camera operations are properly handled asynchronously. 
* **Expo Version Compatibility:** Verify if upgrading/downgrading Expo versions resolves the issue. 
* **Device-Specific Issues:** This bug's behavior can depend heavily on the device hardware and software. 
* **Reporting to Expo:** Report this issue on the official Expo GitHub repository to inform the Expo team and community.
